## Rhea Mimi Carillo 

No issues; I was already familiar with the git commands needed in this assignment :).

I had issues figuring out how to use Git commands and discerning between GitHub and Git. 
I am grateful I had assistance from Kassie and Rhea because they helped me a lot with figuring out which 
commands to do along with Professor Capaul's video.
