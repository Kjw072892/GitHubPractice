## Rhea Mimi Carillo 

No issues; I was already familiar with the git commands needed in this assignment :).

## Salima Hafurova
I had issues figuring out how to use Git commands and discerning between GitHub and Git. 
I am grateful I had assistance from Kassie and Rhea because they helped me a lot with figuring out which 
commands to do along with Professor Capaul's video. 

## Kassie Whitney
I had issues using Bash with my folder that's inside OneDrive, so I had to create a local repo that's specifically on 
my computer that's not attached to the cloud. Everything else I had no issues with this assignment after looking up 
all the git bash commands.
